/**
 * You are given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers.
 * <p>
 * For each number A[i] such that 0 â‰¤ i < N, we want to count the number of elements of the array that are not the divisors of A[i]. We say that these elements are non-divisors.
 * <p>
 * For example, consider integer N = 5 and array A such that:
 * <p>
 * A[0] = 3
 * A[1] = 1
 * A[2] = 2
 * A[3] = 3
 * A[4] = 6
 * For the following elements:
 * <p>
 * A[0] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
 * A[1] = 1, the non-divisors are: 3, 2, 3, 6,
 * A[2] = 2, the non-divisors are: 3, 3, 6,
 * A[3] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
 * A[4] = 6, there aren't any non-divisors.
 * Write a function:
 * <p>
 * class Solution { public int[] solution(int[] A); }
 * that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the amount of non-divisors.
 * <p>
 * The sequence should be returned as:
 * <p>
 * a structure Results (in C), or
 * a vector of integers (in C++), or
 * a record Results (in Pascal), or
 * an array of integers (in any other programming language).
 * For example, given:
 * <p>
 * A[0] = 3
 * A[1] = 1
 * A[2] = 2
 * A[3] = 3
 * A[4] = 6
 * the function should return [2, 4, 3, 2, 0], as explained above.
 * <p>
 * Assume that:
 * <p>
 * N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
 * each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..2 * N].
 * Complexity:
 * <p>
 * expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
 * expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
 * Elements of input arrays can be modified.
